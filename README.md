## 💡 Philosophy

> "Reality is fluid. Perspective is everything." - Fabric Engine

Some principles I try to follow:
- **First principles thinking** - Understanding the why before the how
- **Clean architecture** - Code that's maintainable and understandable
- **Automation first** - Build systems that build themselves
- **Continuous learning** - Always exploring new challenges

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, C++, TypeScript, Bash, Rust (learning), CUDA
- **Systems**: Multi-agent orchestration, Event-driven architecture, Thread-safe concurrency
- **DevOps**: Git workflows, GitHub Actions, CI/CD automation, Shell scripting, Docker-ready builds
- **AI/ML**: LLM integration, Knowledge graphs, Semantic search, Agent systems
- **Architecture**: Compositional design, Plugin systems, Middleware patterns, Infrastructure as Code
