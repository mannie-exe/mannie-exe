# Building Realities, One System at a Time

Working on systems and exploring how information can be structured and understood.

## 🌌 Current Focus

Working on [Atlas](https://github.com/inherent-design/atlas) - A framework for knowledge-driven AI agent systems with multi-agent orchestration.

## 🛠️ Recent Work

### Systems & Architecture
- **[Fabric Engine](https://github.com/inherent-design/fabric)** - A perspective-based engine in C++20 exploring how information presentation changes with viewpoint
- **[ReX](https://github.com/inherent-design/ReX)** - Compositional content architecture for isomorphic web applications
- **[Atlas](https://github.com/inherent-design/atlas)** - Multi-agent AI orchestration with knowledge graph integration

### AI/ML Exploration
- Started with Markov chains ([markie.py](https://github.com/mannie-exe/markie.py))
- Currently working on LLM orchestration systems
- Exploring agent coordination, knowledge persistence, and semantic understanding

### Low-Level Performance
- CUDA programming for GPU acceleration
- OpenGL/graphics programming
- Thread-safe, cross-platform system architecture

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Reality is fluid. Perspective is everything." - Fabric Engine

Some principles I try to follow:
- **First principles thinking** - Understanding the why before the how
- **Clean architecture** - Code that's maintainable and understandable
- **Continuous learning** - Always exploring new challenges

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

**Languages**: Python, C++, TypeScript, Rust (learning), CUDA
**Systems**: Multi-agent orchestration, Event-driven architecture, Thread-safe concurrency
**AI/ML**: LLM integration, Knowledge graphs, Semantic search, Agent systems
**Architecture**: Compositional design, Plugin systems, Middleware patterns
