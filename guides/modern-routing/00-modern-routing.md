# Modern Routing: Your Journey Begins Here

*"You're my route, you're my source"* ‚Äì and this is where we start that beautiful journey together.

Welcome to a practical exploration of infrastructure that works in the real world. These guides combine hands-on experience with solid engineering principles, showing you how to build services that handle actual traffic, real users, and unexpected challenges.

## What We're Building Together

These guides focus on getting things done while understanding why they work. Each one tackles real infrastructure challenges with well-researched solutions, complete with references and citations. You can follow them sequentially or jump to whatever matches your current needs.

## The Modern Routing Experience

### üéµ [01 - You Are My Route, You Are My Source](./01-you-are-my-route-you-are-my-source.md)
*The Foundation Groove*

Where it all begins. We'll explore Coolify, Crafty Controller, and BlueMap ‚Äì not as separate islands, but as interconnected services that dance together in perfect harmony. This is where you'll discover the cross-cutting complexity that makes infrastructure beautiful.

**Key Vibes:**
- Service-in-service networking patterns
- Docker daemon security configuration with journald logging
- The art of surgical security overrides
- Real-world Coolify privilege management

### üåä [02 - Migration & Real-World Problems](./02-migration-real-world-problems.md)
*The Evolution Movement*

Life doesn't happen in isolation, and neither does infrastructure. We'll navigate the elegant dance between legacy systems and modern approaches, showing you how to make decisions that honor both performance and humanity.

**Key Vibes:**
- Hybrid architecture decision-making
- Performance vs. security trade-offs
- Tunnel vs. direct routing strategies
- Migration patterns that actually work

### üîê [03 - Security That Actually Works](./03-security-that-actually-works.md)
*The Protection Rhythm*

Security isn't about building walls ‚Äì it's about creating flows that protect while they enable. We'll implement defense-in-depth strategies that feel natural, not burdensome.

**Key Vibes:**
- Per-container security orchestration
- Defense-in-depth layering
- Incident response procedures
- Security monitoring that flows

### üöÄ [04 - Exploration Launchpad](./04-exploration-launchpad.md)
*The Reference Universe*

Your complete navigation system for diving deeper. Every tool, every technique, every reference point across all our guides, organized for exploration and discovery.

**Key Vibes:**
- Complete reference compilation
- Deep-dive research paths
- Tool ecosystems and integrations
- Community resources and connections

## The Modern Talking Touch

Each guide carries that spirit of smooth precision ‚Äì technical depth delivered with style and personality. Infrastructure should feel as elegant as it is functional, and these guides aim to show you how the pieces fit together into something greater than the sum of its parts.

## How to Navigate This Journey

- **Sequential Flow**: Start with 01 and let each guide build naturally
- **Curiosity-Driven**: Jump to whatever matches your immediate needs
- **Reference-Rich**: Use 04 as your deep-dive resource library
- **Practical Focus**: Every concept is backed by working examples

## The Cross-Cutting Approach

These guides show you the connections between different layers ‚Äì how Docker daemon configuration affects service security, how DNS choices impact performance, how routing decisions influence your operational complexity. You'll see the patterns that make complex infrastructure manageable.
