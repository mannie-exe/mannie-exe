## What We're Building (And Why It Matters)

**The Goal**: Transform a basic VPS into a secure, scalable platform that can host multiple services with proper domain names and HTTPS certificates.

**What You'll Have When We're Done**:
- Multiple services accessible via clean URLs (`https://app.yourdomain.com`)
- Automatic TLS certificates that renew themselves
- Protection against common attacks and monitoring
- A clear understanding of when to use different approaches

**Why This Matters**:
- **Security**: Encrypted connections protect your data and users
- **Professionalism**: Real domains instead of `http://192.168.1.100:8080`
- **Scalability**: Patterns that work for 1 service or 100 services
- **Reliability**: Infrastructure that doesn't break when you're asleep

## What Are We Actually Hosting?

**TL;DR**: We're running Minecraft servers with web-based management, plus 3D map visualization. But the networking patterns apply to *any* self-hosted services.

**The Specific Services**:
- **üèóÔ∏è Crafty Controller** - Web-based Minecraft server management panel (`https://crafty.yourdomain.com`)
  - Think: cPanel but for Minecraft servers
  - Manages multiple server instances, backups, logs, player management
  - Runs on port 8000, needs HTTPS for security

- **üó∫Ô∏è BlueMap** - 3D web-based world visualization (`https://mcmap.yourdomain.com`) 
  - Renders your Minecraft worlds as interactive 3D maps in the browser
  - Like Google Earth but for your Minecraft builds
  - Runs on port 8100, serves static files + real-time updates
  - **üéØ Plot twist**: It's a service *inside* Crafty, creating fun networking challenges

- **‚ö° Coolify** - Self-hosted deployment platform (`https://coolify.yourdomain.com`)
  - Think: Heroku/Vercel but on your own server
  - Manages Docker containers, SSL certificates, reverse proxy (Traefik)
  - The foundation that makes hosting other services trivial

**Why These Services Matter for Learning**:
- **Real-world complexity**: Multiple ports, different protocols, actual users
- **Security requirements**: Authentication, SSL, public internet exposure
- **Performance considerations**: Static files, WebSocket connections, resource management
- **Practical value**: You end up with genuinely useful infrastructure

*The same patterns we'll use work for hosting anything: web apps, APIs, databases, monitoring tools, personal clouds, etc.*

## Networking Fundamentals (The 5-Minute Primer)

If you've never set up DNS or understand what happens when you type a URL, start here. If you're comfortable with these concepts, [jump to implementation](#getting-started).

### **What Happens When You Visit a Website**

1. **DNS Lookup**: Your browser asks "What IP address is `google.com`?"
2. **Connection**: Browser connects to that IP address on port 443 (HTTPS)
3. **TLS Handshake**: Browser and server establish encrypted connection
4. **Request/Response**: Browser asks for webpage, server responds

### **The Key Players**

**Domain Registrar**: Where you bought your domain (`yourdomain.com`)
**DNS Provider**: Controls where `yourdomain.com` points (often Cloudflare)
**VPS**: Your virtual server with an IP address (like `46.202.176.108`)
**Reverse Proxy**: Routes incoming requests to the right service (Traefik)
**TLS Certificate**: Proves your server is who it claims to be

### **What We're Actually Doing**

**Before**: Services only accessible via IP and port (`http://46.202.176.108:8080`)
**After**: Services accessible via domain (`https://app.yourdomain.com`)

**The Magic**: DNS points domains to your VPS, reverse proxy routes requests to services, TLS certificates encrypt everything.

---

## Getting Started

### **What You Need**

**Required**:
- VPS with SSH access (we'll use Ubuntu 22.04)
- Domain name with DNS managed by Cloudflare
- Basic command line comfort

**Recommended Server Specs**:
- 4GB RAM (minimum 2GB)
- 2 CPU cores
- 40GB storage
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

### **Step 1: Basic VPS Security**

Before anything else, secure your server:

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Create non-root user (if you don't have one)
sudo adduser yourusername
sudo usermod -aG sudo yourusername

# Configure SSH (disable root login, key-only auth)
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Set: PermitRootLogin no
# Set: PasswordAuthentication no
sudo systemctl restart ssh

# Basic firewall
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443
sudo ufw enable
```

**Why This Matters**: An unsecured VPS will be compromised within hours. These steps prevent the most common attack vectors.

### **Step 2: Install Coolify (Your Service Manager)**

Coolify automates service deployment and provides a reverse proxy (Traefik) that handles TLS certificates^[1]:

```bash
# Install Coolify
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | sudo bash

# Wait for installation to complete
# Access at http://YOUR_VPS_IP:8000
```

**Important**: Create your admin account immediately after installation. The first person to visit the setup page gets full access^[2].

## Understanding the Two Routing Pathways

All routing starts with **Cloudflare DNS**, but from there, traffic can take two different paths to your VPS:

### **Pathway 1: Direct VPS Access**
*For administrative services like Coolify dashboard*

```
User ‚Üí Cloudflare DNS ‚Üí Your VPS ‚Üí Traefik ‚Üí Service
```

**DNS Configuration:**
```dns
coolify.yourdomain.com    A    YOUR_VPS_IP    ; Proxied: OFF (üü†)
```

**What Happens:**
1. User visits `https://coolify.yourdomain.com`
2. Cloudflare DNS returns your VPS IP (`46.202.176.108`)
3. Browser connects directly to your VPS
4. Traefik handles TLS with Let's Encrypt and routes to service

**Best For:** Admin panels, development, monitoring, low-traffic services

### **Pathway 2: Cloudflare Tunnel**
*For public services like Crafty Controller*

```
User ‚Üí Cloudflare DNS ‚Üí Cloudflare Edge ‚Üí Tunnel ‚Üí Your VPS ‚Üí Service
```

**DNS Configuration:**
```dns
crafty.yourdomain.com    CNAME    tunnel-uuid.cfargotunnel.com    ; Proxied: ON (üü°)
```

**What Happens:**
1. User visits `https://crafty.yourdomain.com`
2. Cloudflare DNS points to tunnel endpoint
3. Request hits Cloudflare's edge network first
4. Cloudflare routes through secure tunnel to your VPS
5. Cloudflared daemon forwards to your service

**Best For:** Public websites, APIs, high-traffic services, DDoS protection^[3,8]

### **Implementing Pathway 1: Direct Access (Coolify)**

Let's set up Coolify using the direct pathway:

**Step 1: Configure DNS (Direct Pathway)**
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Records
2. Add record:
   - Type: `A`
   - Name: `coolify` (or `luminode` as in our example)
   - IPv4 address: `YOUR_VPS_IP`
   - Proxy status: üü† **DNS only** (not proxied)

*This creates the direct pathway: DNS ‚Üí VPS*

**Step 2: Configure Coolify Domain**
```bash
# Edit Coolify configuration
sudo nano /data/coolify/source/.env

# Add this line:
APP_URL=https://coolify.yourdomain.com

# Restart Coolify
cd /data/coolify/source
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart
```

**Step 3: Wait and Test the Direct Pathway**
- Wait 2-3 minutes for Let's Encrypt certificate generation^[7,10]
- Visit `https://coolify.yourdomain.com`
- You should see the Coolify login page with a valid certificate
- Traffic flow: `Your Browser ‚Üí Cloudflare DNS ‚Üí Your VPS ‚Üí Traefik ‚Üí Coolify`

**If It Doesn't Work**: Check the [debugging section](#common-issues) below^[8].

---

## Adding More Services

Now that you understand the pattern, let's add different types of services:

### **Deploying a Simple Web Application**

**Option A: Using Coolify's Interface**
1. Login to Coolify ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí New Project
2. Add Resource ‚Üí Application
3. Choose source (Git repository or Docker image)
4. Set domain: `app.yourdomain.com`
5. Deploy

**Option B: Custom Docker Service**
1. Coolify ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí New Project
2. Add Resource ‚Üí Docker Compose
3. Use this template:

```yaml
services:
  webapp:
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.webapp.rule=Host(`app.yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.webapp.entrypoints=https"
      - "traefik.http.routers.webapp.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
```

### **The Service-in-Service Problem**

**Real-World Example**: BlueMap runs inside Crafty Controller

Sometimes you need to expose a service that's running inside another service. This is where Docker networking gets tricky.

**The Problem**: Service runs on `localhost:8100` inside a container, but Traefik can't reach `localhost` from its own container.

**The Solution**: Use `host.docker.internal`

```bash
# Create custom Traefik configuration
sudo nano /data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/nested-service.yaml
```

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    nested-service:
      rule: Host(`nested.yourdomain.com`)
      entryPoints: [https]
      service: nested-service
      tls:
        certresolver: letsencrypt
  services:
    nested-service:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: 'http://host.docker.internal:8100'  # Key insight!
```

```bash
# Restart Traefik to load new config
docker restart coolify-proxy
```

**Why This Works**: `host.docker.internal` is Docker's way of letting containers access the host machine's network^[5]. This approach is detailed in community guides for BlueMap integration with Coolify and Traefik^[6].

## Implementing Pathway 2: Cloudflare Tunnels

*Setting up the tunnel pathway for public services*

Now let's implement the tunnel pathway for services that need Cloudflare's protection and performance benefits.

### **When Each Pathway Makes Sense**

**Use Direct Pathway (like Coolify) For**:
- Administrative interfaces that need reliable access
- Development/staging environments
- Services where you want to bypass any external dependencies

**Use Tunnel Pathway (like Crafty) For**:
- Public websites and applications
- APIs with high traffic
- Services needing DDoS protection
- When you want to hide your VPS IP

### **Setting Up Your First Tunnel**

You have two options for deploying and configuring cloudflared^[3]:

#### **Option A: Coolify Service + Zero Trust UI (Recommended)**

**Step 1: Deploy via Coolify Services Panel**
1. Navigate to your Coolify dashboard
2. Go to Services ‚Üí Add New Service  
3. Search for "cloudflared" in the service templates
4. Deploy the cloudflared service
5. The service will automatically create a tunnel and provide connection details

**Step 2: Configure via Zero Trust Dashboard**
1. Visit [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com)^[4]
2. Networks ‚Üí Tunnels ‚Üí Your tunnel (created by the service)
3. Public Hostnames ‚Üí Add a public hostname
4. Configure:
   - Subdomain: `api`
   - Domain: `yourdomain.com` 
   - Service: `http://localhost:3000`
5. Save

**Step 3: DNS Record Auto-Created**
Cloudflare automatically creates the DNS record:
```dns
api.yourdomain.com    CNAME    tunnel-uuid.cfargotunnel.com    ; Proxied: ON
```

#### **Option B: Manual Installation**

If you need custom configuration or prefer manual control:

**Step 1: Create Tunnel in Cloudflare**
1. Visit [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Networks ‚Üí Tunnels ‚Üí Create a tunnel
3. Choose "Cloudflared"
4. Name it descriptively: `production-services-2025`
5. Save and copy the tunnel token

**Step 2: Install on VPS**
```bash
# Install cloudflared
curl -L --output cloudflared.deb \
  https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb

# Install as service with token
sudo cloudflared service install --token YOUR_TUNNEL_TOKEN
sudo systemctl enable --now cloudflared
```

**Note**: The Coolify service approach simplifies deployment and uses the Zero Trust web interface for configuration, eliminating the need for manual config files while maintaining full functionality.

### **Advanced Tunnel Configuration**

#### **Using Zero Trust Dashboard (Recommended)**

For most configurations, use the web interface^[4]:
1. Zero Trust ‚Üí Networks ‚Üí Tunnels ‚Üí Your tunnel
2. Public Hostnames ‚Üí Add/Edit
3. Configure advanced settings:
   - **TLS Settings**: No-TLS verify for services with self-signed certs
   - **HTTP Settings**: Custom headers, host header override
   - **Access Control**: Cloudflare Access policies

#### **Manual Configuration Files**

For complex setups or when using manual installation:

```bash
# Create tunnel with specific configuration
sudo mkdir -p /etc/cloudflared
sudo nano /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
```

```yaml
tunnel: YOUR-TUNNEL-UUID
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/YOUR-TUNNEL-UUID.json

ingress:
  # Public API
  - hostname: api.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:3000

  # Service with self-signed certificates
  - hostname: secure.yourdomain.com
    service: https://localhost:8443
    originRequest:
      noTLSVerify: true

  # Nested service (like BlueMap in Crafty)
  - hostname: map.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:8100

  # Catch-all
  - service: http_status:404
```

```bash
# Restart with new configuration
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
```

**Note**: When using the Coolify service, the container can be extended with persistent storage for config files, but the Zero Trust dashboard provides equivalent functionality with a better user experience.

## Real-World Implementation: Both Pathways in Action

Here's how we implemented both routing pathways for our actual services:

### **Our Complete Architecture**

**Services Using Direct Pathway:**
- **Coolify** (`luminode.inherent.design`): Admin dashboard
- **BlueMap** (`mcmap.inherent.design`): 3D world viewer

**Services Using Tunnel Pathway:**
- **Crafty Controller** (`crafty.inherent.design`): Public Minecraft management

### **Side-by-Side Pathway Comparison**

| Aspect                     | Direct Pathway (Coolify/BlueMap)      | Tunnel Pathway (Crafty)                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **DNS Record**             | `A` record to VPS IP, not proxied (üü†) | `CNAME` to tunnel, proxied (üü°)            |
| **Traffic Flow**           | DNS ‚Üí VPS ‚Üí Traefik ‚Üí Service         | DNS ‚Üí Cloudflare ‚Üí Tunnel ‚Üí VPS ‚Üí Service |
| **TLS Termination**        | Let's Encrypt at Traefik              | Cloudflare Edge + Origin cert             |
| **DDoS Protection**        | Basic (Cloudflare DNS only)           | Full (Cloudflare edge network)            |
| **VPS IP Exposure**        | Visible in DNS                        | Hidden behind Cloudflare                  |
| **Certificate Management** | Auto-renewal every 90 days            | 15-year Origin certificates               |
| **Best For**               | Admin access, reliability             | Public services, performance              |

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

**1. DNS Configuration (Both Pathways)**
```dns
# Direct Pathway services
luminode.inherent.design    A    46.202.176.108    ; Proxied: OFF (üü†)
mcmap.inherent.design       A    46.202.176.108    ; Proxied: OFF (üü†)

# Tunnel Pathway services
crafty.inherent.design      CNAME your-tunnel-uuid.cfargotunnel.com    ; Proxied: ON (üü°)
```

**Key Insight**: Both pathways start with Cloudflare DNS, but the record type and proxy setting determine which pathway traffic takes.

**2. Direct Pathway Configuration (Coolify)**^[1,7]
```bash
# Configure Coolify for direct access
echo "APP_URL=https://luminode.inherent.design" >> /data/coolify/source/.env
cd /data/coolify/source && sudo docker compose restart

# Result: Traefik automatically generates Let's Encrypt certificate
# Traffic: User ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí VPS ‚Üí Traefik ‚Üí Coolify
```

**3. Crafty via Coolify**
Deploy Crafty as Docker Compose service in Coolify:
```yaml
services:
  crafty:
    image: registry.gitlab.com/crafty-controller/crafty-4:latest
    ports:
      - "8443:8443"  # HTTPS interface
      - "8100:8100"  # BlueMap HTTP
      - "25565:25565"  # Minecraft
    volumes:
      - crafty_data:/crafty/app/config
      - crafty_servers:/crafty/servers
    environment:
      - CRAFTY_WEB_PORT=8443
      - CRAFTY_HTTPS=true
```

**4. Tunnel Pathway Configuration (Crafty)**

Using Zero Trust Dashboard:
1. Navigate to Networks ‚Üí Tunnels ‚Üí Your tunnel
2. Public Hostnames ‚Üí Add hostname:
   - Subdomain: `crafty`
   - Domain: `inherent.design`
   - Service: `https://host.docker.internal:8443`
   - Additional settings ‚Üí TLS ‚Üí No TLS Verify: ON

Alternatively, with config file:
```yaml
# /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
ingress:
  - hostname: crafty.inherent.design
    service: https://host.docker.internal:8443
    originRequest:
      noTLSVerify: true  # Crafty uses self-signed cert
```

# Result: Cloudflare handles edge TLS, tunnel forwards to VPS
# Traffic: User ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Cloudflare Edge ‚Üí Tunnel ‚Üí VPS ‚Üí Crafty

**5. Direct Pathway with Docker Networking (BlueMap)**^[5,6,7]
```yaml
# /data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/bluemap.yaml
# This uses the direct pathway but handles Docker networking complexity
http:
  routers:
    mcmap-router:
      rule: Host(`mcmap.inherent.design`)
      entryPoints: [https]
      service: bluemap-mcmap
      tls:
        certresolver: letsencrypt  # Let's Encrypt via direct pathway
  services:
    bluemap-mcmap:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: 'http://host.docker.internal:8100'  # Key Docker insight

# Traffic: User ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí VPS ‚Üí Traefik ‚Üí Docker Host ‚Üí BlueMap
```

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### **TLS Certificate Problems**

**Symptom**: "TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT" instead of proper certificate

**Cause**: Let's Encrypt challenge failed or ACME data corrupted^[7]

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check certificate status
sudo cat /data/coolify/proxy/acme.json | jq '.letsencrypt.Certificates[].domain'

# If empty or corrupted, reset:
docker stop coolify-proxy
sudo rm /data/coolify/proxy/acme.json
sudo touch /data/coolify/proxy/acme.json
sudo chmod 600 /data/coolify/proxy/acme.json
sudo chown 9999:root /data/coolify/proxy/acme.json
docker start coolify-proxy

# Wait 2-3 minutes for certificate generation
```

### **502 Bad Gateway Errors**

**Most Common Cause**: Service not reachable from Traefik^[8]

**Debug Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Check if service responds locally
curl -I http://localhost:PORT

# 2. Check Docker networking
docker ps | grep your-service

# 3. Test from Traefik container
docker exec coolify-proxy ping host.docker.internal

# 4. Fix service URL in Traefik config
# Replace localhost with host.docker.internal
```

### **DNS Not Resolving**

**Check DNS propagation**:
```bash
dig yourdomain.com
nslookup yourdomain.com

# Test from different locations
dig @8.8.8.8 yourdomain.com
dig @1.1.1.1 yourdomain.com
```

**Verify proxy status matches your setup**:
- Direct access: Proxy status OFF (üü†)
- Tunneled: Proxy status ON (üü°) or auto-managed

---

## Scaling and Advanced Patterns

### **Multiple Services on One VPS**

The beauty of this setup is that adding services is straightforward:

**For each new service**:
1. Choose direct or tunneled based on use case
2. Add DNS record with appropriate proxy setting
3. Deploy via Coolify or add Traefik configuration
4. Test and monitor

**Resource monitoring**:
```bash
# Check system resources
htop
docker stats

# Monitor disk usage
df -h
docker system df
```

### **Environment Separation**

**Development vs Production**:
- Use subdomains: `dev.yourdomain.com`, `staging.yourdomain.com`
- Separate tunnel configurations
- Different TLS certificate management

**Database and Backend Services**:
- Keep databases internal (no external access)
- Use Docker networks for inter-service communication
- Document service dependencies

### **Backup and Recovery**

**Critical data to backup**:
```bash
# Coolify configuration
/data/coolify/source/.env
/data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/

# TLS certificates (auto-regenerate, but good to have)
/data/coolify/proxy/acme.json

# Tunnel configuration
/etc/cloudflared/config.yml
/root/.cloudflared/*.json

# Application data volumes
docker volume ls
```

**Automated backup script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /opt/backup-config.sh
BACKUP_DIR="/opt/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup configs
cp -r /data/coolify/source/.env "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp -r /data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/ "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp /etc/cloudflared/config.yml "$BACKUP_DIR/" 2>/dev/null

# Compress
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz" "$BACKUP_DIR"
rm -rf "$BACKUP_DIR"

echo "Backup created: $BACKUP_DIR.tar.gz"
```

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### **Health Monitoring**

**Simple availability check**^[8,9]:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /opt/health-check.sh
SERVICES=("coolify.yourdomain.com" "app.yourdomain.com" "api.yourdomain.com")

for service in "${SERVICES[@]}"; do
  if curl -sf --max-time 10 "https://$service" > /dev/null; then
    echo "‚úÖ $service"
  else
    echo "‚ùå $service - DOWN"
    # Add alerting here (email, webhook, etc.)
  fi
done
```

**TLS certificate expiration**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check certificate expiration
for domain in "${SERVICES[@]}"; do
  expiry=$(echo | openssl s_client -servername "$domain" -connect "$domain:443" 2>/dev/null | \
           openssl x509 -noout -dates | grep notAfter | cut -d= -f2)
  days_left=$(( ($(date -d "$expiry" +%s) - $(date +%s)) / 86400 ))

  if [ $days_left -lt 30 ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  $domain expires in $days_left days"
  fi
done
```

### **Regular Maintenance Tasks**

**Weekly**:
- Check system updates: `sudo apt update && sudo apt list --upgradable`
- Verify backups are running
- Review service logs for errors

**Monthly**:
- Update Docker images: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- Clean up unused Docker resources: `docker system prune`
- Review and rotate SSH keys if needed

**Quarterly**:
- Review and update firewall rules
- Audit user accounts and permissions
- Test disaster recovery procedures

---

## Going Further

### **Advanced Security**

**Fail2Ban for brute force protection**:
```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban
```

**SSH key rotation**:
```bash
# Generate new key locally
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@domain.com"

# Add to server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/new_key user@server

# Remove old keys from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Regular security updates**:
```bash
# Enable automatic security updates
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
```

### **Performance Optimization**

**Enable HTTP/3 in Cloudflare**:
- Dashboard ‚Üí Speed ‚Üí Optimization ‚Üí HTTP/3: Enable

**Traefik compression**:
```yaml
# Add to Traefik dynamic config
http:
  middlewares:
    compression:
      compress: {}
  routers:
    your-service:
      middlewares: ["compression"]
```

**CDN and caching**:
- Use Cloudflare's caching for static assets
- Configure appropriate cache headers in your applications
- Consider Redis for session storage

### **Multi-Server Scaling**

When you outgrow a single VPS:

**Load balancing**:
- Multiple VPS instances behind Cloudflare Load Balancer
- Database on separate server or managed service
- Shared storage for persistent data

**Geographic distribution**:
- VPS in different regions
- Tunnel endpoints in multiple locations
- Database replication for global apps

docker exec coolify-proxy ping host.docker.internal

# Restart services
docker restart coolify-proxy
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared

# View logs
docker logs coolify-proxy --tail 50
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared -f
```

### **Configuration Files**
- **Coolify**: `/data/coolify/source/.env`
- **Traefik Dynamic**: `/data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/*.yaml`
- **Tunnel**: `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml`
- **TLS Certificates**: `/data/coolify/proxy/acme.json`

### **When Things Break**
1. Check the logs (`docker logs`, `journalctl`)
2. Verify DNS resolution (`dig`, `nslookup`)
3. Test service connectivity (`curl`, `ping`)
4. Review configuration files for syntax errors
5. Restart services in order: application ‚Üí traefik ‚Üí tunnel

Remember: **Every problem has been solved before**. Document your solutions and share them with others making the same journey.
